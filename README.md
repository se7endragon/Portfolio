Portfolio Repository of my academic and self learning projects

Some of the projects do not include data in this repo due to the size limit.

## Contents

#### Publication
- Solar Panel Tilt Angle Optimization Using Machine Learning Model: A Case Study of Daegu City, South Korea : Energies, 2020. published as a co-author.
#### Deep Learning
- DBZ_GAN: Built a generative model that generates new anime character image that resembles the original animation. Used minimal samples of character images scraped from google with high quality generated images. Developed Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Generative Adversarial Network with conditional training procedure.
- Stock Prediction using Event Embedding : Built a prototype model for predicting S&P500 index using Deep Learning architecture. Used Natural Language Processing technique to analyze news text.
#### Machine Learning




#### TODO list
- add, Translate, Define problems of Data_Mining 
- Translate and add DA_Project 
- Extra ML projects should be added.
- Hyperlink the corresponding texts
- Add EDA section.
